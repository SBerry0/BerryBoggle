| 1/7/2025 | 2:20-3:00pm | First I updated the test cases (took a while I had to use "git pull origin master"). Then I put the trie into this repository and I started the dfs process. I'm next going to finish up the dfs and start the testing on the testcases. |


To add a new row to the table, click into a cell and then hit shift-enter.
