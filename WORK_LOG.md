| 1/6/2025  | 9:30-9:50am  |                                                                                                                           I was talking about our strategy with our table and we decided on DFS and a TST to store the dictionary words. |
| 1/7/2025  | 2:20-3:00pm  | First I updated the test cases (took a while I had to use "git pull origin master"). Then I put the trie into this repository and I started the dfs process. I'm next going to finish up the dfs and start the testing on the testcases. |
| 1/9/2025  | 12:45-1:45pm |                              I wrote the rest of the DFS, I decided to do something a little weird and return an arrayList inside the recursion. It is close to working, but I have duplicates to work with so I have to fix that first. |
| 1/12/2025 | 4:00-4:30pm  |                                                                  The way I solved the repeats was to remove the word from the dictionary by setting the word end to false when I find a word. Finished everything up and added comments. |
